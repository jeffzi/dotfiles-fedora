# jeffzi's Dotfiles

Fedora Dotfiles managed with a bare git repository.

* `setup_fedora.sh` is a heavily modified and extended version of 
[Fedora and Centos Ultimate Setup Scripts](https://github.com/David-Else/fedora-ultimate-setup-script)
for my development setup on Fedora 34.

* [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) window manager
* [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) application launcher
